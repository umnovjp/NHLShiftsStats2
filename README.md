# NHLShiftsStats2
## Background
Original repo is located at https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftStats1. It was working in 98% of games. But with NHL changing its APIs without any announcement I realized that it was better to start new repo from scratch instead of fixing original one. One of the reasons is that trying to fix issues with original repo created too many new hurdles. Like fixing one led to a new one. Another NHL stats repo https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftStats1 will be easier to fix. 
## Usage
First thing is to select a date. And remember to select date when games actually were played. ![calendar](image.png). Then you will be prompted to select a game. Press one button to select a game. ![select a game](image-1.png).
