# NHLShiftsStats3
## Background
Original repo is located at https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftStats1. It was working in 98% of games. But with NHL changing its APIs without any announcement I realized that it was better to start new repo from scratch instead of fixing original one. One of the reasons is that trying to fix issues with original repo created too many new hurdles. Like fixing one led to a new one. And as script progressed, I knew I am on the right path after 2 years of JavaScript experience. What I could not accomplish with 1200 lines of code last year, I did with just 400 lines. Compare script.js files! Another NHL stats repo https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftStats1 will be easier to fix.
