# NHLShiftsStats3
## Background
Original repo is located at https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftStats3. It was working in 98% of games. But with NHL changing its APIs without any announcement I realized that it was better to start new repo from scratch instead of fixing original one. One of the reasons is that trying to fix issues with original repo created too many new hurdles. Like fixing one led to a new one. And as script progressed, I knew I am on the right path after 2 years of JavaScript experience. What I could not accomplish with 1200 lines of code last year, I did with just 400 lines. Compare script.js files! Another NHL stats repo https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftStats1 will be easier to fix.
## Usage
First thing is to select a date. And remember to select date when games actually were played. ![calendar](image.png) 
Then you will be prompted to select a game. Press one button to select a game. ![select a game](image-1.png) Separate tables will be displayed for home and away team defensemen. ![Alt text](image-2.png) You can easy determine defensive pairs from this table. It is not that easy for forward lines. Because lines of three forwards are not that easy to display in a 2D table. This is how it is done currently ![Alt text](image-3.png). Also, special teams are frequently played with 2 or 4 forwards depending on if it is penalty kill or power play. This script limits 5x5 play as play with 2D and 3F only. This is done to exclude PP with 4F and 1 D, and sometimes playes where D comes out of penalty box where his team plays with 3D and 2F till next stoppage. Still it includes PP with 3F and 2D, which is usually second PP unit. 

Definition of shift is 10 seconds pair of defensmen or trio of forwards played continuously at the same time.
## Notes
I tried maybe 30-40 different algorithms to come up with reasonable lines combinations. There are 32 teams in NHL. And each of them has its own defensive system. Next, each game is different. Player may be injured in 1st period or may get a game misconduct. There may be multiple penalties resulting in limited 5x5 play. This algorithm works for virtually every game. And if it does not, I will add a list of games where it does not work.

## Known Failures
Some game data are not displayed correctly because of obvious errors in NHL API data. Example is STL at FLA game on 12/21/2023 where data for many shifts are duplicated. Similar example is TOR at CBJ game on 12/23/2023 where many shifts are duplicated while some non existing overlapping shifts are added. Game CBJ at NJD on 12/28/2023 generated unreliable results for DMen because there were 3 of them on ice frequently. Most likely one D(#2?) was dressed as an F, buely wrong. Not sure if this paragraph is still relevant. on 1/21 game 0 H lines are incorrect because #11 played on 2 lines. game 0 on 01/29 12 F but only 11 displayednt game report still counts him as D. Game 4 on 01/09 A has 3 lines only with 12F. Game 1 on 1/14 only 3 h lines are displayed because 3 played on 2 lines. game 8 on 1/15 only 3 lines displayed. game 6 on 1/16 determines lines correctly. but toi .

11F playing in 3 or 4 lines 5 times in January and 3 or more times in December and once in November. Currently game 3 on 01/04 displays 4 lines because H team had 7 Ds but #71 belongs to 2 lines. Game 3 on 01/04 11F but #71 played on 2 lines. on 1/22  game 3 H team 11F #9 played on 2 lines. game 3 on 1/18 #11 played on two lines for 11F home team. Game 9 on 1/13 A has 3 lines with 7D.

Game 1 04/24 and game DAL on 04/29 are examples of games with line chabges and stars game on 05/07; game 0 3/12 game 3 3/16 failed because final lineup is empty. game 1 3/15 failed because final lineup is empty. game 3 3/14 failed because final lineup is empty. game 8 2/15 all lines changed in 2nd. game 6 2/20 4th line wrong.
